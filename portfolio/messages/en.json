I live in Istanbul, Turkey.\nSince my early years, I have been fascinated by how the applications I used actually worked. This curiosity led me into the world of software development, and over time I realized that it was not just a hobby but a field in which I wanted to build my career.\nWith this motivation, I began studying **Computer Engineering** at university, and I am now only one course away from graduating. Throughout my studies, I strengthened my theoretical foundation and developed various projects to put this knowledge into practice.\nAlthough I initially focused on **Backend** technologies, I gradually became interested in **Frontend** development as well, which guided me toward becoming a **Full Stack developer**.\nI am currently focused on improving my skills, learning new technologies, and seeking **internship** or **job** opportunities where I can contribute and continue to grow within a team.",
